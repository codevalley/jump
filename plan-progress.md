# Jump Service Implementation Progress

## Documentation Standards
- All public items (functions, structs, traits, etc.) MUST have doc comments
- Documentation should follow Rust's documentation conventions:
  - Use `///` for doc comments on items
  - Use `//!` for module-level documentation
  - Include examples in doc comments where appropriate
  - Document error conditions and panics
  - Use markdown formatting in doc comments
- Each module should have a module-level doc comment explaining its purpose
- Complex algorithms or business logic should have inline comments
- Error types should document possible error conditions
- Configuration options should be well-documented
- Use `#[deprecated]` attribute with explanation when deprecating features
